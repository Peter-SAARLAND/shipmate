# Frequently asked questions

## I'm already using Semantic Versioning. Can I use Shipmate?

Of course. **Shipmate** simply automates your semantic versioning process based on commit messages.

## I used a different tool for Semantic Versioning before. Will Shipmate work with my Repository?

Yes. If your tool used **GitLab Releases** for versioning, **Shipmate** simply takes over and continues based upon your commit messages.

## I don't want to use Conventional Commits. Can I still use Shipmate?

No.

## Does Shipmate push to my repository?

No.

## Does Shipmate generate a CHANGELOG?

Yes, on the **Release** page of the latest release.
